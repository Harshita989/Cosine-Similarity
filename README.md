Cosine Similarity
Cosine similarity is a metric used to measure the similarity between two non-zero vectors. It is widely used in various fields, including information retrieval, natural language processing, and recommendation systems. The cosine similarity calculates the cosine of the angle between two vectors, providing a value between -1 and 1, where 1 indicates that the vectors are identical, 0 means they are orthogonal (perpendicular), and -1 indicates that they are diametrically opposed.
The cosine similarity between two vectors A and B is calculated using the following formula:
Copycosine_similarity(A, B) = (A · B) / (||A|| * ||B||)
Where:

A · B is the dot product of the two vectors
||A|| is the Euclidean norm (magnitude) of vector A
||B|| is the Euclidean norm (magnitude) of vector B

The dot product between two vectors is calculated by multiplying the corresponding components of the vectors and summing them up:
CopyA · B = (a1 * b1) + (a2 * b2) + ... + (an * bn)
The Euclidean norm of a vector is calculated by taking the square root of the sum of the squared components:
Copy||A|| = sqrt((a1^2) + (a2^2) + ... + (an^2))
Here are some key properties of cosine similarity:

Range: The cosine similarity ranges from -1 to 1, where 1 indicates that the vectors are identical, 0 means they are orthogonal (perpendicular), and -1 indicates that they are diametrically opposed.
Magnitude Invariance: The cosine similarity is invariant to the magnitude of the vectors, meaning that it only considers the angle between the vectors, not their lengths.
Interpretation: A high cosine similarity value (close to 1) indicates that the vectors are pointing in the same direction and are similar, while a low value (close to 0 or -1) indicates that the vectors are dissimilar or pointing in opposite directions.

Cosine similarity is widely used in various applications, such as:

Information Retrieval: To measure the similarity between a query and a document, where both are represented as term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) vectors.
Natural Language Processing: To measure the similarity between word embeddings or sentence embeddings.
Recommendation Systems: To find similar items (e.g., movies, products, users) based on their feature vectors.
Data Mining and Machine Learning: As a distance metric in clustering algorithms, nearest neighbor search, and other algorithms.

It's important to note that cosine similarity is most useful when dealing with sparse, high-dimensional data, such as text data or feature vectors, as it effectively measures the orientation of the vectors rather than their absolute magnitudes.
